"2015 saw some highly anticipated returns by some of our favorite artists---Sleater-Kinney, Wilco, Kendrick Lamar, Father John Misty, Sufjan Stevens---but what perhaps what was most notable about this year in music was the amount of remarkable debut albums from new artists. Leon Bridges, Tobias Jesso Jr, Beach Slang, Palehound and Natalie Prass all wowed us with their very first full-length efforts---a reason to celebrate this year's work but also look ahead to the great music that they might produce in 2016 and beyond. For this year's list, we polled editors, writers and interns and wound up with votes for over 200 albums. Whittling that down to 50 was no easy task, but without further ado, we present the Best Albums of 2015."
